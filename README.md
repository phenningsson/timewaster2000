# timewaster2000
TimeWaster2000, final assignment for the course MPROG at Stockholm University. A very barebones app with little to no design created to help a user waste time whenever necessary. Includes a calculator, a prime number calculator, a little quiz and some miscellaneous features.  Created in the spring 2023.
